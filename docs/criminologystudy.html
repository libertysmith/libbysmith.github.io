<h1>Exploring Risk and Protective Factors in College Student Victimization</h1>
<p>A Criminology Study</p>
<p>Co-Authors: Hoda Elsafadi and Haley Puddy</p>
<section id="about" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about">About</h2>
<p>The study examines victimization among U.S. college students, focusing on identifying risk factors that increase vulnerability to victimization and protective factors that mitigate it. Victimization, defined as harm inflicted by another person or group, is a significant concern on college campuses, affecting the well-being of individuals and communities (Turchik &amp; Hassija, 2014). Existing research identifies behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption, drug use, partying, and engaging in multiple sexual partnerships as critical risk factors for victimization (Abbey et al., 2001; Testa &amp; Livingston, 2009). For instance, alcohol use has been linked to both physical and sexual victimization, with women who drink heavily reporting higher rates of sexual assault (Abbey, Parkhill, &amp; Buck, 2005). Similarly, risky behaviors like drug use and partying often increase situational vulnerability, making students more susceptible to harm (Chan et al., 2016). Conversely, protective factors, such as social connectedness, healthy decision-making, and good sleep quality, have been associated with resilience against victimization (Banyard &amp; Cross, 2008; Howell et al., 2014). Social connectedness, for example, can provide emotional support and foster a sense of safety, while healthy decision-making reduces engagement in risky activities (Kuo et al., 2015).</p>
<p>This study builds on prior literature to address two main research questions:</p>
<p>(1) What risk factors increase the likelihood of victimization for college students?</p>
<p>(2) What protective factors decrease the likelihood of victimization for college students?</p>
<p>Secondary questions explore the roles of healthy decision-making, engagement in risky behaviors, and the applicability of social bond theory in reducing victimization. By identifying and analyzing these factors, the study aims to inform strategies for minimizing victimization and promoting safety on college campuses.</p>

<section id="methodology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The study utilizes data from the Spring 2021 American College Health Association National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA III), analyzing responses from over 96,000 students across 137 U.S. institutions. A combination of multivariate logistic regression models and hierarchical clustering analyses was employed. The regression models assess the relationships between risk and protective factors with three victimization types: violent, sexual, and intimate partner violence (IPV). Hierarchical clustering, using Gower’s distance and complete linkage, identifies patterns in victimization and related behaviors. Variables were carefully coded, and missing data were addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE).</p>
<p>The study employed multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the relationships between specific behaviors, demographic factors, and victimization outcomes. Logistic regression is particularly suited for this analysis as it predicts binary outcomes, such as whether an individual experienced victimization (yes or no), while controlling for multiple independent variables simultaneously. This methodology enabled the researchers to isolate the effects of individual risk factors, such as drug use or partying, on the likelihood of experiencing violent, sexual, or intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization. Variables were carefully coded, with protective factors like weeknight sleep and risk factors like multiple sexual partners included as predictors. Demographic variables, including gender and sexual orientation, were also incorporated to examine their moderating effects. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), ensuring a robust dataset for analysis. The regression models allowed for the identification of statistically significant predictors, providing insights into which factors most strongly correlate with victimization.</p>

<section id="findings-from-multivariate-logistic-regression" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-from-multivariate-logistic-regression">Findings from Multivariate Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>The regression analysis revealed that several risk factors significantly increase the likelihood of victimization among college students. Drug use, having multiple sexual partners, and frequent partying were consistently associated with higher odds of violent, sexual, and intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization. While alcohol use was positively linked to sexual victimization, it was not significantly associated with violent or IPV victimization. Among the protective factors, greater weeknight sleep emerged as the only variable that significantly reduced the odds of all three victimization types. However, some results deviated from expectations—volunteering and self-reported good overall health were associated with increased victimization, challenging conventional assumptions about their protective roles. Demographic factors also played a role, with findings indicating that being male increased the odds of violent victimization but decreased the odds of sexual and IPV victimization. These findings offer nuanced insights into how specific behaviors and characteristics influence victimization risks.</p>
</section>
<section id="findings-from-hierarchical-clustering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="findings-from-hierarchical-clustering">Findings from Hierarchical Clustering</h2>
<p>The clustering analysis provided additional context for understanding patterns of victimization among college students. Clusters characterized by high rates of risky behaviors, such as frequent partying and multiple sexual partners, exhibited elevated victimization rates across all types. Interestingly, clusters with higher levels of social connectedness, such as spending time with friends, were not consistently associated with reduced victimization, contradicting aspects of social bond theory. Protective factors like weeknight sleep aligned with regression findings, with clusters exhibiting higher sleep averages showing lower victimization rates. Some clusters highlighted unexpected patterns, such as those with low rates of volunteering paired with high victimization, suggesting that contextual or external factors may influence outcomes. Additionally, the analysis confirmed that questioning sexual orientation and not being in a relationship were correlated with higher victimization rates. While clustering supported several findings from the regression models, it also highlighted areas where relationships were less clear, emphasizing the complexity of victimization dynamics among college students.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This study acknowledges several limitations that may affect the generalizability and interpretation of its findings. The cross-sectional design of the survey restricts the ability to infer causality, as it captures only a snapshot of behaviors and victimization experiences at a single point in time. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data introduces potential biases, such as social desirability bias, where respondents may underreport risky behaviors or overreport protective ones. Survey data inherently limits the depth of understanding, as standardized questions may fail to capture the full complexity and context of individual experiences. For instance, nuances in the timing, frequency, or situational factors surrounding risky behaviors and victimization are often missing. Furthermore, the ACHA-NCHA III survey’s pre-set categories may not reflect all relevant risk and protective factors, potentially omitting variables critical to understanding victimization. The inability to verify the accuracy of responses or account for nonresponse bias also introduces uncertainty. These limitations underscore the need for complementary qualitative research and longitudinal studies to provide a richer, more nuanced understanding of victimization among college students.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-research" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="future-research">Future Research</h2>
<p>Future research should address the limitations of this study by employing longitudinal designs to better understand causal relationships between risk and protective factors and victimization among college students. Incorporating qualitative methodologies, such as in-depth interviews or focus groups, could provide a richer context for understanding the nuances of victimization experiences and the situational factors that influence risk. Additionally, expanding survey instruments, decision-making, and other potential protective factors could improve the depth and scope of data collection. Researchers should also explore the role of cultural, institutional, and environmental factors that may interact with individual behaviors to affect victimization risk. Particularly the inclusion of additional theories from other fields can enable greater depth in future investigations of this sort. These directions would contribute to a deeper understanding of victimization and inform more effective prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
