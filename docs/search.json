    "text": "knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)\n\n\nAnalyze a Qualtrics Survey Template and Improve it\nThis Movie Rental Behaviors Survey Template is analyzed for the purposes of assessing its internal and external validity. You can take or review the unedited survey here.\n\nHow is the survey structured?\n\n\nWhat is it composed of?\n\n\nHow are they ordered?\nIn this comprehensive survey, we delve into the nuances of movie renting preferences and habits, leveraging the power of data analytics to extract meaningful insights. Our survey comprises a total of 18 crafted Qualtrics questions, each strategically designed to uncover the fascinating layers of consumer behavior.\nThe journey begins with the first question, which unfolds into a captivating narrative with 12 sub-questions, presented with the Likert scale responses. These sub-questions serve as our compass, guiding us through the myriad of choices and preferences that shape the modern movie-watching experience. From preferred movie ratings to rental frequency, we explore it all, giving each response a quantitative weight that illuminates patterns and trends.\nDiving deeper, we encounter binary questions, offering respondents a simple yet impactful choice between “yes” and “no.” These questions serve as data points that punctuate our survey, allowing us to draw clear distinctions and make informed decisions based on dichotomous preferences.\nWe venture into the realm of ordinal and nominal multiple-choice responses, steering away from traditional Likert scales to gather unique insights that go beyond the conventional. These responses are the paintbrush strokes on our canvas, adding color and texture to the rich tapestry of movie-watching habits.\nIn the final leg of our survey, we turn our attention to five demographic questions. These demographic data points - income, gender, marital status, location, and age - are the pillars upon which we build a comprehensive understanding of our respondents. Through these demographic lenses, we paint a vivid portrait of the diverse tapestry of movie enthusiasts.\nIn sum, this survey isn’t merely a collection of questions; it’s an intricate data tapestry. It’s an exploration of preferences, a journey through habits, and a window into the lives of movie aficionados. With data analytics as our compass, we’re prepared to unveil the hidden gems of consumer behavior and gain profound insights into the world of movie renting.\n\n\nWhat can be done to improve the respondants’ experiences?\nI re-created and structured this survey for maximum internal and external validation in a new version that can be taken and reviewed here.\nIn crafting this survey, I re-engineered and thoughtfully structured it with an unwavering focus on the pursuit of internal and external validation as well as minimizing non-responses. Our commitment to this approach stems from a deep understanding of the nuances involved in data analytics, which has led us to take several strategic measures.\nRecognizing that a significant portion of our respondents are likely to engage with this survey on mobile devices, we’ve implemented a design that optimizes user experience. To enhance clarity and mitigate potential respondent fatigue, the formidable Likert scale with its 12 subquestions has been artfully deconstructed into three distinct sections. By doing so, we encourage respondents to engage with these most thought-provoking questions in digestible portions, reducing the likelihood of survey abandonment.\nMoreover, we’ve positioned these questions at the outset of the survey, capturing the respondent’s attention and fostering engagement right from the start. This not only contributes to the overall quality of the data collected but also sets a captivating tone for the survey experience.\nIn an effort to make the survey more user-friendly, we’ve innovatively transformed Likert scale responses into user-friendly drop-down menus (seen below). This user-centric adaptation simplifies the process of answering, enhancing the overall survey experience.\n\n\n\nDrop Down Image\n\n\nTo further streamline respondent engagement, we’ve strategically incorporated force response questions and implemented skip logic. These features serve as invaluable tools in maintaining a minimal non-response rate while ensuring that the survey adapts to the unique preferences and behavior of each user.\n\n\n\nTHE END"

It also provides real-time data, visualization tools, and the ability to export data for in-depth analysis. Google Trends is a valuable tool for marketers, researchers, and anyone interested in understanding search trends and consumer behavior.\n\n\nRstudio’s gtrendsR package\nWhile both Google Trends website and the gtrendsR package in R allow you to access Google Trends data, there are differences in how you interact with and utilize these methods.\n\n# Load package\nlibrary(gtrendsR)\n# Pull Google Trends Data from \"all time\" interval\nBidenTrumpElection = gtrends(c(\"Trump\",\"Biden\",\"election\"), time = \"all\")\n# Graph identical plot seen in web example\npar(family=\"Georgia\")\nplot(BidenTrumpElection)\n\n\n\n\nThe Google Trends website welcomes users with its intuitive, user-friendly interface, akin to an explorer’s trusted map and compass. Here, one can quickly visualize trends, explore geographic variations, and uncover valuable insights with ease.\nThe ‘gtrendsR’ package has optional arguments for many of the same customizations users can change on the website including but not limited to time, geolocation, and search type that the webpage offers. Both have near identical data querying and toggling settings. While both Google Trends website and the gtrendsR package in R allow you to access Google Trends data, there are differences in how you interact with and utilize these methods. Main differences lie in availability of a user-friendly interface verses a programmic one which enable more visualization and computation methods through base R and other R packages in analyzing the trends.\nOn the other hand, the gtrendsR package in R equips adventurers with a toolkit for programmatic exploration. It’s like having a set of powerful scientific instruments at your disposal. This method empowers users with the ability to harness the full analytical prowess of R and other complementary R packages. Whether you seek to uncover hidden trends, apply advanced statistical methods, or create stunning visualizations, the programmatic nature of this package amplifies your analytical capabilities.\nSee an example below. We will create a heat map through the ggplot2 package to extrapolate on correlations.\n\n# Load ggplot2 package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create new list object specific heat map purposes\nBidenTrumpElection2 &lt;- gtrends(c(\"Trump\", \"Biden\", \"election\"), \n                               time = \"today+5-y\", \n                               geo = (\"US\"))\n\n# Convert \"date\" column to POSIXct format\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$date &lt;- as.POSIXct(BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$date)\n\n# Replace \"&lt;1\" with 0 in the \"hits\" column\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits[BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits == \"&lt;1\"] &lt;- 0\n\n# Convert \"hits\" to continuous\nBidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits &lt;- as.numeric(BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time$hits)\n\n# Create the heatmap\nheatmap_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = BidenTrumpElection2$interest_over_time, aes(x = date, y = keyword, fill = hits)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Google Trends Heatmap\", x = \"Date\", y = \"Keyword\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Print the heatmap\nprint(heatmap_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END"

    "text": "knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)\n\n\nLatent Semantic Text Analysis with Quanteda Package in R\n\nAnalyzing Tweets surrounding the Biden-Xi Summit of 2021\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing and text analysis that is used to discover the relationships and associations between words and documents. LSA is primarily applied to large collections of textual data, such as a corpus of documents, to uncover hidden patterns and extract semantic information.\nLSA can uncover semantic relationships and associations that go beyond simple keyword matching. It can reduce the “curse of dimensionality” in high-dimensional text data. It is often used for information retrieval, document summarization, and text mining.\nLSA has 3 major assumptions. 1) Documents are non-positional (“bag of words”). The “bag of words” approach assumes that the order of the words does not matter. What matters is only the frequency of the single words. 2) Concepts are understood as patterns of words where certain words often go together in similar documents. 3) Words only have one meaning given the contexts surrounding the patterns of words.\nTo demonstrate LSA, we will implement the technique on text data from 2021 tweets about the Biden and Xi summit.\n\n# We will work with the following packages\nlibrary(quanteda)\n\nPackage version: 3.3.1\nUnicode version: 13.0\nICU version: 69.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 20 of 20 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\nlibrary(quanteda.textmodels)\nlibrary(quanteda.textplots)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# The twitter data is coming from a publicly available file on Github\nsummit &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datageneration/datamethods/master/textanalytics/summit_11162021.csv\")\n\nRows: 14520 Columns: 90\n\n\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (50): screen_name, text, source, reply_to_screen_name, hashtags, symbol...\ndbl  (26): user_id, status_id, display_text_width, reply_to_status_id, reply...\nlgl  (10): is_quote, is_retweet, quote_count, reply_count, ext_media_type, q...\ndttm  (4): created_at, quoted_created_at, retweet_created_at, account_create...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nWe can see this Twitter (now X) data has 90 columns containing everything about the Tweets from screenname, reply count, and hashtags. Its a detailed dataset. We do need to take some steps prepping the data to make it readable by the quanteda package for LSA. This includes converting them through the tokenization process. Tokenization involves breaking down a text document into individual units or “tokens,” which are typically words, but they can also be subword units like subword pieces in some tokenization models.\nAfter tokenization, the resulting token object is again filtered through a Document Feature Matrix. A Document-Feature Matrix (Also known as Document Term Matrix) that represents the entire corpus of documents. Each row of the DTM corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a term (word) in the corpus. The matrix entries represent the frequency of each term in each document or other suitable measures like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores.\n\n# Create new object containing only the text data from tweets\nsum_twt = summit$text\ntoks = tokens(sum_twt)\nsumtwtdfm &lt;- dfm(toks)\n\nIn LSA text analysis involving larger amounts of text or large corpora, we often would include a step called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In the SVD step of LSA, the DFM is factorized into three matrices. These matrices are based on the tokenized terms, and the relationships between documents and terms are captured by the vectors associated with the tokens. Resulting in a reduced dimensional object that requires less computational power. This step is included in the command “textmodel_lsa” from the quanteda package executed in the code below.\nBelow, LSA is applied to the totality of the text data from the Tweets into a document-feature matrix object (sumtwtdfm). The resulting sum_lsa model contains the LSA model of Summit Tweets. The resulting LSA model of the data can then be interpreted based on the a priori needs of the project. We can see from the resulting summary of the LSA object below that the texts contain 145,200 docs (or Tweets in this case), over 160,000 features (AKA dictionary of text), and 10 sk or singular values obtained from the SVD. Singular values play a significant role in Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) by quantifying the strength of the latent semantic relationships captured during the dimensionality reduction process. The Matrix_low_rank and data statistics components contain the results of the LSA transformation, but they are represented as a large matrix in sparse format. In this case, it’s stored as a dgCMatrix object, which is a sparse matrix type in R. The dimensions of the matrix are not provided in the summary, but it’s quite large, indicating the transformed LSA space.\n\n# Latent Semantic Analysis\nsum_lsa &lt;- textmodel_lsa(sumtwtdfm)\nsummary(sum_lsa)\n\n                Length    Class     Mode   \nsk                     10 -none-    numeric\ndocs               145200 -none-    numeric\nfeatures           160960 -none-    numeric\nmatrix_low_rank 233713920 -none-    numeric\ndata            233713920 dgCMatrix S4     \n\n\nWe can specify LSA analysis to look at specific features of the text. Below, this section again tokenizes the tweet data (sum_twt) and creates a document-feature matrix (tweet_dfm) without punctuation. Remember, tokenization breaks the text into individual words or tokens, and dfm() creates a document-feature matrix where rows represent documents (tweets) and columns represent terms. Here, we will focus the functions of the quanteda package on the hashtags in our Tweets. We create a document-feature matrix (tag_dfm) specifically for hashtags by selecting terms that start with “#”. Then we identify the top 50 most frequently occurring hashtags.\n\ntweet_dfm &lt;- tokens(sum_twt, remove_punct = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  dfm()\nhead(tweet_dfm)\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 6 documents, 16,029 features (99.89% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    breaking news us president biden amp communist china leader xi\n  text1        1    1  1         1     1   1         1     2      1  1\n  text2        0    0  0         0     0   0         0     0      0  0\n  text3        0    0  0         0     1   0         0     0      0  1\n  text4        0    0  0         1     1   0         0     0      0  1\n  text5        0    0  0         0     1   0         0     0      0  1\n  text6        0    0  0         0     1   0         0     0      0  1\n[ reached max_nfeat ... 16,019 more features ]\n\ntag_dfm &lt;- dfm_select(tweet_dfm, pattern = \"#*\")\ntoptag &lt;- names(topfeatures(tag_dfm, 50))\nhead(toptag, 10)\n\n [1] \"#china\"          \"#biden\"          \"#xijinping\"      \"#joebiden\"      \n [5] \"#america\"        \"#americans\"      \"#coronavirus\"    \"#fentanyl\"      \n [9] \"#xi\"             \"#uyghurgenocide\"\n\n\nNow perhaps we want to do a network analysis of hashtag proliferation surrounding the Summit event. The second line below create a feature co-occurrence matrix (FCM) for hashtags, which captures how often hashtags co-occur in tweets. The next line selects hastags that match the top 50 hashtags from the FCM. Lastly, the final line below generates a network plot of the co-occurrence relationships among the top 50 hashtags. min_freq sets a minimum frequency threshold for displaying hashtags, edge_alpha controls edge transparency, and edge_size adjusts edge thickness.\nWe can see the bulk of the Twitter discourse containing hastags consisted of topics pertaining to fentanyl and covid-19. There are three other less-frequently discussed hashtag topics that branched off from this discussion. Biden tags branched off into other discussions surrounding Uyghers and Human Rights. Another branch-off emanates from the tag #China which appears to consist of US-Taiwan relations based on the frequency of the tags #US and #Taiwan. The final branch off is the #ccp tag which is the smallest and is paired with the #xijinping. Through this visualization of the hashtag network, we can see how various topics are become related to the initial discussion and can be seen as a family of topics that naturally arise together in public discourse.\n\nlibrary(\"quanteda.textplots\")\ntag_fcm &lt;- fcm(tag_dfm)\ntopgat_fcm &lt;- fcm_select(tag_fcm, pattern = toptag)\ntextplot_network(topgat_fcm, min_freq = 50, edge_alpha = 0.8, edge_size = 5)\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want to do a network analysis of users in the Twitter discussion? Similar to the hashtag section, we need to create a document-feature matrix (user_dfm) for user mentions by selecting terms that start with “@”. Like before, we identifies the top 50 most frequently mentioned users. Then, create an FCM for user mentions and select user mentions that match the top 50 mentioned users. Finally, we generate a network plot of the co-occurrence relationships among the top 50 mentioned users. min_freq sets a minimum frequency threshold, and other parameters control the appearance of the network plot.\nAs the plot shows, the bulk of the Tweet discussion is surrounding the users @capitalonearena, @nba, @eneskanter, @pelicansnba, and @washwizards\n\nuser_dfm &lt;- dfm_select(tweet_dfm, pattern = \"@*\")\ntopuser &lt;- names(topfeatures(user_dfm, 50))\nhead(topuser, 20)\n\n [1] \"@potus\"           \"@joebiden\"        \"@politico\"        \"@eneskanter\"     \n [5] \"@jendeben\"        \"@nwadhams\"        \"@nba\"             \"@washwizards\"    \n [9] \"@pelicansnba\"     \"@capitalonearena\" \"@kevinliptakcnn\"  \"@foxbusiness\"    \n[13] \"@morningsmaria\"   \"@scmpnews\"        \"@uyghur_american\" \"@nytimes\"        \n[17] \"@petermartin_pcm\" \"@nahaltoosi\"      \"@phelimkine\"      \"@kaylatausche\"   \n\nuser_fcm &lt;- fcm(user_dfm)\nhead(user_fcm, 20)\n\nFeature co-occurrence matrix of: 20 by 741 features.\n                 features\nfeatures          @youtube @bfmtv @cnn @lauhaim @barackobama @joebiden\n  @youtube               0      0    0        0            0         0\n  @bfmtv                 0      0    1        1            1         1\n  @cnn                   0      0    0        1            1         1\n  @lauhaim               0      0    0        0            1         1\n  @barackobama           0      0    0        0            0         1\n  @joebiden              0      0    0        0            0         3\n  @kamalaharris          0      0    0        0            0         0\n  @hillaryclinton        0      0    0        0            0         0\n  @billclinton           0      0    0        0            0         0\n  @cbsnews               0      0    0        0            0         0\n                 features\nfeatures          @kamalaharris @hillaryclinton @billclinton @cbsnews\n  @youtube                    0               0            0        0\n  @bfmtv                      1               1            1        1\n  @cnn                        1               1            1        1\n  @lauhaim                    1               1            1        1\n  @barackobama                1               1            1        1\n  @joebiden                   1               1            1        1\n  @kamalaharris               0               1            1        1\n  @hillaryclinton             0               0            1        1\n  @billclinton                0               0            0        1\n  @cbsnews                    0               0            0        0\n[ reached max_feat ... 10 more features, reached max_nfeat ... 731 more features ]\n\nuser_fcm &lt;- fcm_select(user_fcm, pattern = topuser)\ntextplot_network(user_fcm, min_freq = 20, edge_color = \"firebrick\", edge_alpha = 0.8, edge_size = 5)\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have coded to perform text pre-processing, LSA, and network analysis on Twitter data to explore the relationships between hashtags and user mentions in tweets. The result is a visualization of co-occurrence networks for the most frequent hashtags and user mentions, which can help identify trends and connections in the data. Due to the previously mentioned assumptions for LSA, it has limitations, including difficulty handling polysemy (words with multiple meanings) and the inability to capture context-specific information. More advanced techniques like Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) have become popular alternatives in recent years for capturing semantic relationships in text.\n\n\n\nKeyword-in-Context Analysis and X-ray plots with Quanteda Package in R\n\nAnalyzing Presidential Speeches post 1949\nBelow, I demonstrate some additional functionalities of the quanteda package where we analyze and visualize textual data, specifically examining the usage of certain keywords in American presidential speeches. We only want to focus on more recent speeches here, as indicated by the second line of code. The KWIC command performs a Keyword-in-Context (KWIC) analysis on the corpus. It looks for instances of the keyword “american” in the speeches and generates an X-ray plot that shows the distribution and context of the keyword in the text. ‘textplot_xray()’ is a function that visualizes the KWIC results, providing insights into how the keyword is used in the text. The subsequent code uses textplot_xray() to perform KWIC analysis for multiple keywords: “american,” “people,” and “communist.” It compares the usage and context of these keywords in the text. The resulting visualizations show how each keyword is distributed and used in the corpus.\nOverall, the code demonstrates how to use the “quanteda” and “quanteda.textstats” packages for text analysis and visualization, focusing on examining the distribution and context of specific keywords in American presidential speeches. The resulting X-ray plots provide a visual representation of keyword usage in the corpus. It appears entering the word “communist” was redundant as never appears in the subset of inaugeral speeches since 1949.\n\n# Example extracted from https://quanteda.io/articles/pkgdown/examples/plotting.html\n \nlibrary(quanteda.textstats)\ndata_corpus_inaugural_subset &lt;- \ncorpus_subset(data_corpus_inaugural, Year &gt; 1949)\nkwic(tokens(data_corpus_inaugural_subset), pattern = \"american\") %&gt;%\n  textplot_xray()\n\n\n\ntextplot_xray(\n  kwic(data_corpus_inaugural_subset, pattern = \"american\"),\n  kwic(data_corpus_inaugural_subset, pattern = \"people\"),\n  kwic(data_corpus_inaugural_subset, pattern = \"communist\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END"

For instance, economists, financial analysts, or researchers might scrape economic data from different websites for analysis and forecasting. Companies often use web scraping to collect data on competitors, market trends, pricing, and customer opinions from e-commerce sites, review platforms, and forums, aiding in strategic planning and decision-making. Scholars and students might scrape data from digital libraries, academic journals, or educational websites for research projects, literature reviews, or data-driven studies. Media and content-based websites might scrape news, articles, and blogs from various online sources to aggregate content for their readers. Web scraping helps in SEO optimization and digital marketing strategies by gathering data on keyword rankings, backlinks, and competitor website content.\nWe first loads the tidyverse and rvest libraries, which are essential for data manipulation and web scraping respectively. First, we load the tidyverse and rvest libraries, which are essential for data manipulation and web scraping respectively. Libraries like rvest simplify the extraction of data from web pages, making it accessible even for those with limited programming experience.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\n\nThe script sets the URL to the Wikipedia page for “List of countries by foreign-exchange reserves”. Using rvest, it reads the HTML content of the specified URL and stores it in the variable wikiforreserve. The class function is then used to check the class of the wikiforreserve object.\n\nurl &lt;- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_foreign-exchange_reserves'\n#Reading the HTML code from the Wiki website\nwikiforreserve &lt;- read_html(url)\nclass(wikiforreserve)\n\n[1] \"xml_document\" \"xml_node\"    \n\n\nThe script uses XPath to locate a specific table on the webpage. The XPath is used with html_nodes to select the table, and html_table to convert the HTML table into a data frame. This data frame is stored in the variable foreignreserve. The script then extracts the first table from foreignreserve into the variable fores. It renames the columns of the fores data frame to “Rank”, “Country”, “Forexres”, “Date”, “Change”, “Sources”. The script displays the first 10 country names from the fores data frame.\n\nforeignreserve &lt;- wikiforreserve %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"mw-content-text\"]/div/table[1]') %&gt;%\n  html_table()\nclass(foreignreserve)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nfores = foreignreserve[[1]]\n\n\nnames(fores) &lt;- c(\"Rank\", \"Country\", \"Forexres\", \"Date\", \"Change\", \"Sources\")\ncolnames(fores)\n\n[1] \"Rank\"     \"Country\"  \"Forexres\" \"Date\"     \"Change\"   \"Sources\"  NA        \n[8] NA        \n\nhead(fores$Country, n=10)\n\n [1] \"3,288,000\" \"1,235,700\" \"802,438\"   \"689,235\"   \"606,100\"   \"568,107\"  \n [7] \"455,205\"   \"425,153\"   \"419,360\"   \"384,587\"  \n\n\nWe can then use the stringr library for string manipulation. The script creates a new variable newdate in the fores data frame, which contains the ‘Date’ column data with trailing notes removed. This is done using the str_split_fixed function to split the ‘Date’ column at the “[” character and keeping the first part. Finally, the cleaned and processed data frame fores is written to a CSV file named “fores.csv”, with row names excluded.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\nfores$newdate = str_split_fixed(fores$Date, \"\\\\[\", n = 2)[, 1]\n\n\nwrite.csv(fores, \"fores.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that web scraping should be conducted responsibly and ethically. This includes respecting website terms of service, avoiding overloading servers, and being mindful of privacy and data use regulations.\n\n\nText Mining for Word Cloud using Winston Churchill’s speech “Their Finest Hour.”\nText mining, as demonstrated in the script, is used to analyze large volumes of text data to extract meaningful patterns and trends. For example, analyzing speeches, customer reviews, or social media posts to identify prevalent themes or sentiments. Word clouds are a popular method of visually representing text data. They highlight the most frequent words in a dataset, with word size proportional to frequency. This makes it easy to quickly grasp key themes or topics in the text.These techniques are particularly useful for exploratory analysis of qualitative data, offering a quick and intuitive understanding of the content without the need for deep statistical analysis. Businesses often use text mining and word clouds to analyze customer feedback, reviews, or social media mentions to understand customer needs, preferences, and perceptions. Researchers and students may use these methods to analyze literary works, academic papers, or speeches to identify key themes, stylistic features, or historical trends in language use.\nThe script starts by installing and then loading the easypackages library, which is used to easily load multiple R packages. It then uses the packages function from easypackages to load a suite of packages necessary for text mining and word cloud generation (XML, wordcloud, RColorBrewer, NLP, tm, and quanteda).\n\nlibrary(easypackages)\npackages(\"XML\",\"wordcloud\",\"RColorBrewer\",\"NLP\",\"tm\",\"quanteda\", prompt = T)\n\nLoading required package: XML\n\n\nLoading required package: wordcloud\n\n\nLoading required package: RColorBrewer\n\n\nLoading required package: NLP\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'NLP'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    annotate\n\n\nLoading required package: tm\n\n\nLoading required package: quanteda\n\n\nPackage version: 3.3.1\nUnicode version: 13.0\nICU version: 69.1\n\n\nParallel computing: 20 of 20 threads used.\n\n\nSee https://quanteda.io for tutorials and examples.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'quanteda'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tm':\n\n    stopwords\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:NLP':\n\n    meta, meta&lt;-\n\n\nAll packages loaded successfully\n\n\nThe script encodes a URL (Winston Churchill’s speech) for proper formatting and uses it to download text data from the web. The htmlTreeParse function from the XML package is used to read and parse the HTML content of the webpage. It specifically extracts paragraph elements (\n\n) and stores the text in the churchill variable. The first three elements of churchill are displayed using head. The text is then converted into a vector source (words.vec) for further processing in text mining.\n\nChurchillLocation &lt;-URLencode(\"http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/churchill-hour.htm\")\ndoc.html&lt;- htmlTreeParse(ChurchillLocation, useInternal=TRUE)\nchurchill &lt;- unlist(xpathApply(doc.html, '//p', xmlValue))\nchurchill\n\n [1] \"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n [2] \"\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n [3] \"\\r\\n        At 5:30 a.m. on May 10, 1940, Nazi Germany began a massive attack against\\r\\n        Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.

This delay entailed the loss of fifteen\\r\\nor sixteen French divisions and threw out of action for the critical period\\r\\nthe whole of the British Expeditionary Force. Our Army and 120,000 French\\r\\ntroops were indeed rescued by the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with\\r\\nthe loss of their cannon, vehicles and modern equipment. This loss inevitably\\r\\ntook some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle\\r\\nin France has been lost. When we consider the heroic resistance made by\\r\\nthe French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses\\r\\ninflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may\\r\\nwell be the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and best-equipped\\r\\ntroops might have turned the scale. However, General Weygand had to fight\\r\\nwithout them. Only three British divisions or their equivalent were able\\r\\nto stand in the line with their French comrades.

We must remind them. For\\r\\nthe last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the possibilities\\r\\nof oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty,\\r\\nat the beginning of the last war, of allowing all regular troops to be\\r\\nsent out of the country. That was a very serious step to take, because\\r\\nour Territorials had only just been called up and were quite untrained.\\r\\nTherefore, this Island was for several months particularly denuded of fighting\\r\\ntroops. The Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent\\r\\na mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent\\r\\nbattle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable\\r\\nof fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they\\r\\nhave only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of--the Scharnhorst and\\r\\nthe Gneisenau. We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come out and\\r\\ngain sea superiority in these waters. If they seriously intend it, I shall\\r\\nonly say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and\\r\\nsafeguarded passage through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may\\r\\nplay the part to which he aspires. There is a general curiosity in the\\r\\nBritish Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they\\r\\nwere at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[17] \"Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a\\r\\ngreat scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than\\r\\nwe were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of\\r\\nthis war, before our other troops were trained, and while the B.E.F. had\\r\\nproceeded abroad. Now, the Navy have never pretended to be able to prevent\\r\\nraids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly across and thrown\\r\\nashore at several points on the coast some dark night or foggy morning.\\r\\nThe efficacy of sea power, especially under modern conditions, depends\\r\\nupon the invading force being of large size; It has to be of large size,\\r\\nin view of our military strength, to be of any use. If it is of large size,\\r\\nthen the Navy have something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite\\r\\non. Now, we must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped,\\r\\nwould require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and\\r\\nphotography it would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it,\\r\\nand conduct it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort\\r\\nit; and there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that\\r\\nthis armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and\\r\\nall the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their\\r\\nequipment while they were trying to land. We also have a great system of\\r\\nminefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone know the\\r\\nchannels. If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these minefields,\\r\\nit will be the task of the Navy to destroy the mine-sweepers and any other\\r\\nforces employed to protect them. There should be no difficulty in this,\\r\\nowing to our great superiority at sea. \"                                                                                                                                                            \n[18] \"Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which\\r\\nwe have relied during many years in peace and war.

It would not be a good thing for me to go into details\\r\\nof this. It might suggest ideas to other people which they have not thought\\r\\nof, and they would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange.\\r\\nAll I will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted\\r\\nto the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel\\r\\ntreacheries and stratagems.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n [9] I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred\\r\\nwhen the French High Command failed to withdraw the northern Armies from\\r\\nBelgium at the moment when they knew that the French front was decisively\\r\\nbroken at Sedan and on the Meuse. This delay entailed the loss of fifteen\\r\\nor sixteen French divisions and threw out of action for the critical period\\r\\nthe whole of the British Expeditionary Force. Our Army and 120,000 French\\r\\ntroops were indeed rescued by the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with\\r\\nthe loss of their cannon, vehicles and modern equipment. This loss inevitably\\r\\ntook some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle\\r\\nin France has been lost. When we consider the heroic resistance made by\\r\\nthe French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses\\r\\ninflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may\\r\\nwell be the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and best-equipped\\r\\ntroops might have turned the scale. However, General Weygand had to fight\\r\\nwithout them. Only three British divisions or their equivalent were able\\r\\nto stand in the line with their French comrades. They have suffered severely,\\r\\nbut they have fought well. We sent every man we could to France as fast\\r\\nas we could re-equip and transport their formations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n[10] I am not reciting these facts for the purpose of recrimination. That\\r\\nI judge to be utterly futile and even harmful. We cannot afford it. I recite\\r\\nthem in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we could have had,\\r\\nbetween twelve and fourteen British divisions fighting in the line in this\\r\\ngreat battle instead of only three. Now I put all this aside. I put it\\r\\non the shelf, from which the historians, when they have time, will select\\r\\ntheir documents to tell their stories. We have to think of the future and\\r\\nnot of the past. This also applies in a small way to our own affairs at\\r\\nhome. There are many who would hold an inquest in the House of Commons\\r\\non the conduct of the Governments--and of Parliaments, for they are in\\r\\nit, too--during the years which led up to this catastrophe. They seek to\\r\\nindict those who were responsible for the guidance of our affairs. This\\r\\nalso would be a foolish and pernicious process. There are too many in it.\\r\\nLet each man search his conscience and search his speeches. I frequently\\r\\nsearch mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n[11] Of this I am quite sure, that if we open a quarrel between the past\\r\\nand the present, we shall find that we have lost the future. Therefore,\\r\\nI cannot accept the drawing of any distinctions between members of the\\r\\npresent Government. It was formed at a moment of crisis in order to unite\\r\\nall the Parties and all sections of opinion. It has received the almost\\r\\nunanimous support of both Houses of Parliament. Its members are going to\\r\\nstand together, and, subject to the authority of the House of Commons,\\r\\nwe are going to govern the country and fight the war. It is absolutely\\r\\nnecessary at a time like this that every Minister who tries each day to\\r\\ndo his duty shall be respected; and their subordinates must know that their\\r\\nchiefs are not threatened men, men who are here today and gone tomorrow,\\r\\nbut that their directions must be punctually and faithfully obeyed. Without\\r\\nthis concentrated power we cannot face what lies before us. I should not\\r\\nthink it would be very advantageous for the House to prolong this debate\\r\\nthis afternoon under conditions of public stress. Many facts are not clear\\r\\nthat will be clear in a short time. We are to have a secret session on\\r\\nThursday, and I should think that would be a better opportunity for the\\r\\nmany earnest expressions of opinion which members will desire to make and\\r\\nfor the House to discuss vital matters without having everything read the\\r\\nnext morning by our dangerous foes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n[12] The disastrous military events which have happened during the past\\r\\nfortnight have not come to me with any sense of surprise. Indeed, I indicated\\r\\na fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House that the worst possibilities\\r\\nwere open; and I made it perfectly clear then that whatever happened in\\r\\nFrance would make no difference to the resolve of Britain and the British\\r\\nEmpire to fight on, if necessary for years, if necessary alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n[13] During the last few days we have successfully brought off the great\\r\\nmajority of the troops we had on the line of communication in France; and\\r\\nseven-eighths of the troops we have sent to France since the beginning\\r\\nof the war--that is to say, about 350,000 out of 400,000 men--are safely\\r\\nback in this country. Others are still fighting with the French, and fighting\\r\\nwith considerable success in their local encounters against the enemy.\\r\\nWe have also brought back a great mass of stores, rifles and munitions\\r\\nof all kinds which had been accumulated in France during the last nine\\r\\nmonths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[14] We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful\\r\\nmilitary force. This force comprises all our best-trained and our finest\\r\\ntroops, including scores of thousands of those who have already measured\\r\\ntheir quality against the Germans and found themselves at no disadvantage.\\r\\nWe have under arms at the present time in this Island over a million and\\r\\na quarter men. Behind these we have the Local Defense Volunteers, numbering\\r\\nhalf a million, only a portion of whom, however, are yet armed with rifles\\r\\nor other firearms. We have incorporated into our Defense Forces every man\\r\\nfor whom we have a weapon. We expect very large additions to our weapons\\r\\nin the near future, and in preparation for this we intend forthwith to\\r\\ncall up, drill and train further large numbers. Those who are not called\\r\\nup, or else are employed during the vast business of munitions production\\r\\nin all its branches--and their ramifications are innumerable--will serve\\r\\ntheir country best by remaining at their ordinary work until they receive\\r\\ntheir summons. We have also over here Dominions armies. The Canadians had\\r\\nactually landed in France, but have now been safely withdrawn, much disappointed,\\r\\nbut in perfect order, with all their artillery and equipment. And these\\r\\nvery high-class forces from the Dominions will now take part in the defense\\r\\nof the Mother Country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n[15] Lest the account which I have given of these large forces should\\r\\nraise the question: Why did they not take part in the great battle in France?\\r\\nI must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training and organizing\\r\\nat home, only twelve divisions were equipped to fight upon a scale which\\r\\njustified their being sent abroad. And this was fully up to the number\\r\\nwhich the French had been led to expect would be available in France at\\r\\nthe ninth month of the war. The rest of our forces at home have a fighting\\r\\nvalue for home defense which will, of course, steadily increase every week\\r\\nthat passes. Thus, the invasion of Great Britain would at this time require\\r\\nthe transportation across the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale,\\r\\nand after they had been so transported they would have to be continually\\r\\nmaintained with all the masses of munitions and supplies which are required\\r\\nfor continuous battle--as continuous battle it will surely be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n[16] Here is where we come to the Navy--and after all, we have a Navy.\\r\\nSome people seem to forget that we have a Navy. We must remind them. For\\r\\nthe last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the possibilities\\r\\nof oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty,\\r\\nat the beginning of the last war, of allowing all regular troops to be\\r\\nsent out of the country. That was a very serious step to take, because\\r\\nour Territorials had only just been called up and were quite untrained.\\r\\nTherefore, this Island was for several months particularly denuded of fighting\\r\\ntroops. The Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent\\r\\na mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent\\r\\nbattle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable\\r\\nof fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they\\r\\nhave only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of--the Scharnhorst and\\r\\nthe Gneisenau. We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come out and\\r\\ngain sea superiority in these waters. If they seriously intend it, I shall\\r\\nonly say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and\\r\\nsafeguarded passage through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may\\r\\nplay the part to which he aspires. There is a general curiosity in the\\r\\nBritish Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they\\r\\nwere at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[17] Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a\\r\\ngreat scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than\\r\\nwe were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of\\r\\nthis war, before our other troops were trained, and while the B.E.F. had\\r\\nproceeded abroad. Now, the Navy have never pretended to be able to prevent\\r\\nraids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly across and thrown\\r\\nashore at several points on the coast some dark night or foggy morning.\\r\\nThe efficacy of sea power, especially under modern conditions, depends\\r\\nupon the invading force being of large size; It has to be of large size,\\r\\nin view of our military strength, to be of any use. If it is of large size,\\r\\nthen the Navy have something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite\\r\\non. Now, we must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped,\\r\\nwould require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and\\r\\nphotography it would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it,\\r\\nand conduct it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort\\r\\nit; and there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that\\r\\nthis armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and\\r\\nall the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their\\r\\nequipment while they were trying to land. We also have a great system of\\r\\nminefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone know the\\r\\nchannels. If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these minefields,\\r\\nit will be the task of the Navy to destroy the mine-sweepers and any other\\r\\nforces employed to protect them. There should be no difficulty in this,\\r\\nowing to our great superiority at sea.                                                                                                                                                             \n[18] Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which\\r\\nwe have relied during many years in peace and war. But the question is\\r\\nwhether there are any new methods by which those solid assurances can be\\r\\ncircumvented. Odd as it may seem, some attention has been given to this\\r\\nby the Admiralty, whose prime duty and responsibility is to destroy any\\r\\nlarge sea-borne expedition before it reaches, or at the moment when it\\r\\nreaches, these shores. It would not be a good thing for me to go into details\\r\\nof this. It might suggest ideas to other people which they have not thought\\r\\nof, and they would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange.\\r\\nAll I will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted\\r\\nto the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel\\r\\ntreacheries and stratagems. The House may be assured that the utmost ingenuity\\r\\nis being displayed and imagination is being evoked from large numbers of\\r\\ncompetent officers, well-trained in tactics and thoroughly up to date,\\r\\nto measure and counterwork novel possibilities. Untiring vigilance and\\r\\nuntiring searching of the mind is being, and must be, devoted to the subject,\\r\\nbecause, remember, the enemy is crafty and there is no dirty trick he will\\r\\nnot do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[19] Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was\\r\\nnot able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into Norway\\r\\nacross the Skagerrak? But the conditions in the Channel and in the North\\r\\nSea are in no way like those which prevail in the Skagerrak. In the Skagerrak,\\r\\nbecause of the distance, we could give no air support to our surface ships,\\r\\nand consequently, lying as we did close to the enemy's main air power,\\r\\nwe were compelled to use only our submarines. We could not enforce the\\r\\ndecisive blockade or interruption which is possible from surface vessels.\\r\\nOur submarines took a heavy toll but could not, by themselves, prevent\\r\\nthe invasion of Norway. In the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other\\r\\nhand, our superior naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will\\r\\noperate with close and effective air assistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n[20] This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from\\r\\nthe air, and of the impending struggle between the British and German Air\\r\\nForces. It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale beyond the capacity\\r\\nof our land forces to crush speedily is likely to take place from the air\\r\\nuntil our Air Force has been definitely overpowered. In the meantime, there\\r\\nmay be raids by parachute troops and attempted descents of airborne soldiers.\\r\\nWe should be able to give those gentry a warm reception both in the air\\r\\nand on the ground, if they reach it in any condition to continue the dispute.\\r\\nBut the great question is: Can we break Hitler's air weapon? Now, of course,\\r\\nit is a very great pity that we have not got an Air Force at least equal\\r\\nto that of the most powerful enemy within striking distance of these shores.\\r\\nBut we have a very powerful Air Force which has proved itself far superior\\r\\nin quality, both in men and in many types of machine, to what we have met\\r\\nso far in the numerous and fierce air battles which have been fought with\\r\\nthe Germans. In France, where we were at a considerable disadvantage and\\r\\nlost many machines on the ground when they were standing round the aerodromes,\\r\\nwe were accustomed to inflict in the air losses of as much as two and two-and-a-half\\r\\nto one. In the fighting over Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man's-land,\\r\\nwe undoubtedly beat the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the\\r\\nlocal air, inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after day.\\r\\nAnyone who looks at the photographs which were published a week or so ago\\r\\nof the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops assembled on the beach\\r\\nand forming an ideal target for hours at a time, must realize that this\\r\\nre-embarkation would not have been possible unless the enemy had resigned\\r\\nall hope of recovering air superiority at that time and at that place.\\r\\n\n[21] In the defense of this Island the advantages to the defenders will\\r\\nbe much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk. We hope\\r\\nto improve on the rate of three or four to one which was realized at Dunkirk;\\r\\nand in addition all our injured machines and their crews which get down\\r\\nsafely--and, surprisingly, a very great many injured machines and men do\\r\\nget down safely in modern air fighting--all of these will fall, in an attack\\r\\nupon these Islands, on friendly soil and live to fight another day; whereas\\r\\nall the injured enemy machines and their complements will be total losses\\r\\nas far as the war is concerned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n[22] During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and continuous\\r\\naid to the French Army, both by fighters and bombers; but in spite of every\\r\\nkind of pressure we never would allow the entire metropolitan fighter strength\\r\\nof the Air Force to be consumed. This decision was painful, but it was\\r\\nalso right, because the fortunes of the battle in France could not have\\r\\nbeen decisively affected even if we had thrown in our entire fighter force.\\r\\nThat battle was lost by the unfortunate strategical opening, by the extraordinary\\r\\nand unforseen power of the armored columns, and by the great preponderance\\r\\nof the German Army in numbers. Our fighter Air Force might easily have\\r\\nbeen exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and then we should\\r\\nhave found ourselves at the present time in a very serious plight. But\\r\\nas it is, I am happy to inform the House that our fighter strength is stronger\\r\\nat the present time relatively to the Germans, who have suffered terrible\\r\\nlosses, than it has ever been; and consequently we believe ourselves possessed\\r\\nof the capacity to continue the war in the air under better conditions\\r\\nthan we have ever experienced before. I look forward confidently to the\\r\\nexploits of our fighter pilots--these splendid men, this brilliant youth--who\\r\\nwill have the glory of saving their native land, their island home, and\\r\\nall they love, from the most deadly of all attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n[23] There remains, of course, the danger of bombing attacks, which will\\r\\ncertainly be made very soon upon us by the bomber forces of the enemy.\\r\\nIt is true that the German bomber force is superior in numbers to ours;\\r\\nbut we have a very large bomber force also, which we shall use to strike\\r\\nat military targets in Germany without intermission. I do not at all underrate\\r\\nthe severity of the ordeal which lies before us; but I believe our countrymen\\r\\nwill show themselves capable of standing up to it, like the brave men of\\r\\nBarcelona, and will be able to stand up to it, and carry on in spite of\\r\\nit, at least as well as any other people in the world. Much will depend\\r\\nupon this; every man and every woman will have the chance to show the finest\\r\\nqualities of their race, and render the highest service to their cause.\\r\\nFor all of us, at this time, whatever our sphere, our station, our occupation\\r\\nor our duties, it will be a help to remember the famous lines:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n[24] He nothing common did or mean, Upon that memorable scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n[25] I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and\\r\\nthe country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which\\r\\nwe base our inflexible resolve to continue the war. There are a good many\\r\\npeople who say, 'Never mind. Win or lose, sink or swim, better die than\\r\\nsubmit to tyranny--and such a tyranny.' And I do not dissociate myself\\r\\nfrom them. But I can assure them that our professional advisers of the\\r\\nthree Services unitedly advise that we should carry on the war, and that\\r\\nthere are good and reasonable hopes of final victory. We have fully informed\\r\\nand consulted all the self-governing Dominions, these great communities\\r\\nfar beyond the oceans who have been built up on our laws and on our civilization,\\r\\nand who are absolutely free to choose their course, but are absolutely\\r\\ndevoted to the ancient Motherland, and who feel themselves inspired by\\r\\nthe same emotions which lead me to stake our all upon duty and honor. We\\r\\nhave fully consulted them, and I have received from their Prime Ministers,\\r\\nMr. Mackenzie King of Canada, Mr. Menzies of Australia, Mr. Fraser of New\\r\\nZealand, and General Smuts of South Africa--that wonderful man, with his\\r\\nimmense profound mind, and his eye watching from a distance the whole panorama\\r\\nof European affairs--I have received from all these eminent men, who all\\r\\nhave Governments behind them elected on wide franchises, who are all there\\r\\nbecause they represent the will of their people, messages couched in the\\r\\nmost moving terms in which they endorse our decision to fight on, and declare\\r\\nthemselves ready to share our fortunes and to persevere to the end. That\\r\\nis what we are going to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n[26] We may now ask ourselves: In what way has our position worsened since\\r\\nthe beginning of the war? It has worsened by the fact that the Germans\\r\\nhave conquered a large part of the coast line of Western Europe, and many\\r\\nsmall countries have been overrun by them. This aggravates the possibilities\\r\\nof air attack and adds to our naval preoccupations. It in no way diminishes,\\r\\nbut on the contrary definitely increases, the power of our long-distance\\r\\nblockade. Similarly, the entrance of Italy into the war increases the power\\r\\nof our long-distance blockade. We have stopped the worst leak by that.\\r\\nWe do not know whether military resistance will come to an end in France\\r\\nor not, but should it do so, then of course the Germans will be able to\\r\\nconcentrate their forces, both military and industrial, upon us. But for\\r\\nthe reasons I have given to the House these will not be found so easy to\\r\\napply. If invasion has become more imminent, as no doubt it has, we, being\\r\\nrelieved from the task of maintaining a large army in France, have far\\r\\nlarger and more efficient forces to meet it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n[27] If Hitler can bring under his despotic control the industries of\\r\\nthe countries he has conquered, this will add greatly to his already vast\\r\\narmament output. On the other hand, this will not happen immediately, and\\r\\nwe are now assured of immense, continuous and increasing support in supplies\\r\\nand munitions of all kinds from the United States; and especially of aeroplanes\\r\\nand pilots from the Dominions and across the oceans coming from regions\\r\\nwhich are beyond the reach of enemy bombers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n[28] I do not see how any of these factors can operate to our detriment\\r\\non balance before the winter comes; and the winter will impose a strain\\r\\nupon the Nazi regime, with almost all Europe writhing and starving under\\r\\nits cruel heel, which, for all their ruthlessness, will run them very hard.\\r\\nWe must not forget that from the moment when we declared war on the 3rd\\r\\nSeptember it was always possible for Germany to turn all her Air Force\\r\\nupon this country, together with any other devices of invasion she might\\r\\nconceive, and that France could have done little or nothing to prevent\\r\\nher doing so. We have, therefore, lived under this danger, in principle\\r\\nand in a slightly modified form, during all these months. In the meanwhile,\\r\\nhowever, we have enormously improved our methods of defense, and we have\\r\\nlearned what we had no right to assume at the beginning, namely, that the\\r\\nindividual aircraft and the individual British pilot have a sure and definite\\r\\nsuperiority. Therefore, in casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating\\r\\nour dangers with a disillusioned eye, I see great reason for intense vigilance\\r\\nand exertion, but none whatever for panic or despair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n[29] During the first four years of the last war the Allies experienced\\r\\nnothing but disaster and disappointment. That was our constant fear: one\\r\\nblow after another, terrible losses, frightful dangers. Everything miscarried.\\r\\nAnd yet at the end of those four years the morale of the Allies was higher\\r\\nthan that of the Germans, who had moved from one aggressive triumph to\\r\\nanother, and who stood everywhere triumphant invaders of the lands into\\r\\nwhich they had broken. During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the\\r\\nquestion: 'How are we going to win?' And no one was able ever to answer\\r\\nit with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly,\\r\\nour terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with victory\\r\\nthat in our folly we threw it away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n[30] We do not yet know what will happen in France or whether the French\\r\\nresistance will be prolonged, both in France and in the French Empire overseas.\\r\\nThe French Government will be throwing away great opportunities and casting\\r\\nadrift their future if they do not continue the war in accordance with\\r\\ntheir treaty obligations, from which we have not felt able to release them.\\r\\nThe House will have read the historic declaration in which, at the desire\\r\\nof many Frenchmen--and of our own hearts--we have proclaimed our willingness\\r\\nat the darkest hour in French history to conclude a union of common citizenship\\r\\nin this struggle.

This is particularly useful for collecting large datasets from public domains, such as government reports, academic papers, or datasets made available by organizations. Manual downloading of numerous files is time-consuming and prone to error. Automation speeds up the process significantly and ensures consistency in file naming and storage. Researchers often use such scripts to gather data for analysis. For instance, downloading a series of reports or articles to perform text analysis, content analysis, or data extraction for further study. Automated scripts can be used to create backups of digital content that might be periodically updated or removed from the original source. The script demonstrates an ethical approach to web scraping by incorporating error handling and managing the rate of download requests, which is important to comply with legal and ethical standards.\nTo prep, we load the purrr and magrittr packages, which are used for functional programming and pipeline-style programming, respectively. We then set the working directory to a specified path. This path needs to be modified by the user to reflect their local directory where files are sourced and copied.\n\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'magrittr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    set_names\n\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/hirel/OneDrive/Documents/SDAR - FW23/Methods of Data Collection/quartogit\")\nsave_dir &lt;- \"C:/Users/hirel/OneDrive/Documents/SDAR - FW23/Methods of Data Collection/quartogit\"\n\nIn order to eventually download the data, we need a specified list of documents to download from the website we are working with. GovInfo.gov offers CSV and JSON filetypes that lists all documents that match our selected search criterion (as pictured below).\nTo demonstrate, we will select to scrape all documents originating from hearings of the House Foreign Affairs committee of the 118th Congress. Reads a CSV file (“file.csv”) into the govfiles dataframe. Extracts specific columns (packageId, pdfLink, id) from govfiles and assigns them to new variables (govfiles$id, pdf_govfiles_url, pdf_govfiles_id).\n\n\n\nGovInfo Search Tool\n\n\n\ngovfiles= read.csv(\"govinfo-search-results-2023-12-08.csv.csv\")\ngovfiles$id = govfiles$packageId\npdf_govfiles_url = govfiles$pdfLink\npdf_govfiles_id &lt;- govfiles$id\n\nBelow we define a function to download PDFs from a given URL to a specified file path. It uses tryCatch for error handling and Sys.sleep to pause between downloads, reducing the risk of overloading the server or being flagged for unusual activity.\n\ndownload_govfiles_pdf &lt;- function(url, id) {\n  tryCatch({\n    destfile &lt;- paste0(save_dir, \"govfiles_\", id, \".pdf\")\n    download.file(url, destfile = destfile, mode = \"wb\") # Binary files\n    Sys.sleep(runif(1, 1, 3))  # Important: random sleep between 1 and 3 seconds to avoid suspicion of \"hacking\" the server\n    return(paste(\"Successfully downloaded:\", url))\n  },\n  error = function(e) {\n    return(paste(\"Failed to download:\", url))\n  })\n}\n\nThe below then executes the function by initiating the download of PDFs from URLs using a purrr functional map. The map iterates over the list of URLs and corresponding IDs, downloading each file. It will also capture the end time after downloads are complete.\n\nstart.time &lt;- Sys.time()\nmessage(\"Starting downloads\")\n\nStarting downloads\n\nresults &lt;- 1:length(pdf_govfiles_url) %&gt;% \n  purrr::map_chr(~ download_govfiles_pdf(pdf_govfiles_url[.], pdf_govfiles_id[.]))\nmessage(\"Finished downloads\")\n\nFinished downloads\n\nend.time &lt;- Sys.time()\ntime.taken &lt;- end.time - start.time\ntime.taken\n\nTime difference of 4.509652 mins\n\nprint(results)\n\n [1] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg53646/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg53646.pdf\"\n [2] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg53237/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg53237.pdf\"\n [3] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg53228/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg53228.pdf\"\n [4] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52788/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52788.pdf\"\n [5] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg53783/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg53783.pdf\"\n [6] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg53078/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg53078.pdf\"\n [7] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52398/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52398.pdf\"\n [8] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52144/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52144.pdf\"\n [9] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52142/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52142.pdf\"\n[10] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52143/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52143.pdf\"\n[11] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52399/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52399.pdf\"\n[12] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg51597/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg51597.pdf\"\n[13] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg52241/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg52241.pdf\"\n[14] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg51383/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg51383.pdf\"\n[15] \"Successfully downloaded: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg51256/pdf/CHRG-118hhrg51256.pdf\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END"

    "text": "knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)\n\n\nAPI Requests of Public Data\n\nExtracting and Analyzing National US Census data\nThe techniques demonstrated here are commonly used in the fields of data science, geography, urban planning, and public policy for several key reasons:\nBy accessing and analyzing Census data, researchers and policymakers can gain insights into demographic trends like age distribution and income levels across different regions. This information is crucial for understanding population dynamics and socioeconomic conditions. Governments and organizations use this type of data to inform decisions on resource allocation. Understanding where different demographics are located helps in planning public services, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and other community needs.\nUrban planners use such data to understand the needs of different areas. For instance, income and age data can help in planning housing, transportation, and commercial developments to better serve the population. Policymakers rely on accurate, up-to-date demographic data to craft policies that address the needs of various population segments. For example, understanding income levels by tract can help in designing economic assistance programs. Researchers in sociology, economics, and other social sciences use Census data to study societal trends, economic conditions, and their impact on different population groups. Companies use demographic data for market analysis, identifying potential customer bases, and deciding where to locate businesses or how to tailor marketing strategies.\nThe popularity of these techniques stems from the richness and accessibility of Census data, combined with the power of tools like R for data analysis and visualization. R’s extensive package ecosystem, particularly for handling spatial data, makes it a preferred choice for professionals working with geographic and demographic data. Additionally, the ability to create both static and interactive visualizations helps in communicating complex data insights in an understandable and visually appealing way.\nThese packages assist in data manipulation, mapping, and accessing Census data. The tidycensus and tigris libraries are loaded, which are specifically designed for working with Census data and TIGER/Line Shapefiles, respectively.\n\nlapply(c(\"tidyverse\", \"ggmap\",\"mapproj\", \"tidycensus\",\"tigris\", \"ggplot2\"), require, character.only = TRUE)\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nLoading required package: ggmap\n\nLoading required package: mapproj\n\nLoading required package: maps\n\n\nAttaching package: 'maps'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    map\n\n\nLoading required package: tidycensus\n\nLoading required package: tigris\n\nTo enable caching of data, set `options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)`\nin your R script or .Rprofile.\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[2]]\n[1] FALSE\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[4]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[5]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[6]]\n[1] TRUE\n\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\n\nThe script guides through obtaining an API key from the U.S. Census Bureau, which is essential for accessing the Census data. The key is then stored in the environment for secure access. The script uses get_acs() function from tidycensus to fetch American Community Survey (ACS) data. In the first instance, it retrieves 2019 data on median age by state, and in the second, 2020 income data by tract for Texas and specifically for Dallas County. The geometry = TRUE parameter in these functions indicates that geographical information for mapping is also being retrieved.\n\ncensus_api_key(\"1eea7d322f1238a00849ad2e66f6258e3a0697e2\", install = TRUE, overwrite=TRUE) \n\nYour original .Renviron will be backed up and stored in your R HOME directory if needed.\n\n\nYour API key has been stored in your .Renviron and can be accessed by Sys.getenv(\"CENSUS_API_KEY\"). \nTo use now, restart R or run `readRenviron(\"~/.Renviron\")`\n\n\n[1] \"1eea7d322f1238a00849ad2e66f6258e3a0697e2\"\n\nacs19 = tidycensus::load_variables(2019, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\nacs19_Profile = load_variables(2019 , \"acs5/profile\", cache = TRUE)\nus_median_age19 &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"state\",\n  variables = \"B01002_001\",\n  year = 2019,\n  survey = \"acs1\",\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  resolution = \"20m\"\n) %&gt;%\n  shift_geometry()\n\nGetting data from the 2019 1-year ACS\n\n\nThe 1-year ACS provides data for geographies with populations of 65,000 and greater.\n\n\nWe then call ggplot2 (part of tidyverse) for creating a map showing the median age by state for 2019.

    "text": "Asian American Pacific-Islanders in the News\n\n\n\nCourtesy of DALL-E\n\n\nCo-Authors: Shivani Chowdury, Sharon Jepkosgei, and Ryan Rynbrandt\n\nSampling Articles from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal\n\n\nA Text Analysis\n\nIf people only learned about AAPI through one news outlet, how would that shape what they think and believe about them?\n\n\nHow would that differ between conservative and liberal outlets?\n\n\nPre- and Post-Covid?\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States, accounting for 7% of the population and growing by 81% between 2000 and 2020 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). As with other ethnic minorities, AAPI have faced discrimination and stereotyping throughout American history. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States, raising concerns about how AAPI are portrayed in the media. Since media outlets play a powerful role in shaping our views of the world around us, it is important to consider how different media outlets portray AAPI, and how this may influence what people think and believe about them.\nPrevious research has shown that the partisanship of news outlets can influence their coverage of a variety of topics, including race and ethnicity. For example, one study found that conservative news outlets were more likely to portray African Americans as criminals and liberal news outlets were more likely to portray them as victims of discrimination (Iyengar & Kinder, 1987).\nAAPI are often stereotyped in the media as being hardworking, intelligent, and successful. Though such “model minority” stereotypes often highlight positive attributes and achievements, they can be harmful in a variety of ways. Being stereotyped as high-achievers results in the perception of AAPI as having fewer needs than other minority groups or being overlooked for opportunities and support. Additionally, it can lead to AAPI feeling pressure to live up to unrealistic expectations and to avoid seeking help when they need it. (Sue et al, 2007). After the pandemic, more clearly negative stereotypes began to arise. One study analyzed a sample of 1,157 news articles from five major US news outlets and found that AAPI were more likely to be portrayed as dirty, diseased, and dangerous in the media during the pandemic. The study also found that AAPI were more likely to be blamed for the pandemic and to be seen as a threat to public health (Jang et al, 2021).\nOur study adds to the existing literature in two important ways. First, whereas previous research looked at the media as a monolithic entity, we seek to explain the influence of media outlets’ partisan leanings in their portrayals of AAPI. Second, we seek to explain the impact of the COVID pandemic in changes in media portrayals of AAPI.\n\n\nMain research questions:\n\n\n1. Does the partisanship of national news outlets influence how they portray AAPI?\n\n\n2. Did this change after the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\n3. To what extent do either liberal or conservative outlets perpetuate stereotypes surrounding AAPI?\nFirst hypotheses: H01: News outlet partisanship has no influence on their portrayal of AAPI HA1: Conservative and liberal news outlets will portray AAPI differently Second hypotheses: H02: Portrayals of AAPI did not change from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic HA2: Portrayals of AAPI changed from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic\nThis research aims to investigate whether the partisanship of national news outlets influences their portrayal of Asian American Pacific Islanders (AAPI), and whether this portrayal changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve this, we employ data-driven text and sentiment analysis techniques using the R and Python programming languages. Our methodology involves the cleaning and parsing of text data collected from a liberal and a conservative news outlet. We intend to extract insights through Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), tidytext in R, and the nltk library in Python. This methodology allows us to uncover distinct patterns in language use and sentiment within news articles and investigate the evolution of these patterns over time.\nOur data collection process involves the systematic retrieval of news articles published by one liberal and one conservative news outlet, both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We sample these articles to create a comprehensive corpus for analysis. Before proceeding with the analysis, we perform data preprocessing, which includes tasks such as removing stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant formatting. We also tokenize and lemmatize the text to ensure uniformity and consistency in word representation. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a topic modeling technique, to identify hidden themes or topics within the news articles. LDA works by assuming that each document in our corpus is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a distribution of words. By applying LDA, we aim to uncover the underlying topics that dominate the discussions related to AAPI in both liberal and conservative news outlets. In R, we utilize the tidytext package to further dissect the text data. Tidytext enables us to organize the text into a structured format suitable for analysis. It facilitates the creation of word frequency tables, sentiment analysis, and sentiment visualization. In Python, we leverage the nltk library for similar text processing tasks.\nOne of our primary objectives is to identify words that are disproportionately found in the liberal versus conservative news articles discussing AAPI. To achieve this, we calculate word frequencies within each subject sentence and compare them between the two outlets. We consider words that exhibit significant differences in usage between the outlets as distinctive AAPI context words. These words and phrases serve as indicators of how AAPI issues are framed differently in liberal and conservative news. To assess whether the portrayal of AAPI changed after the COVID-19 pandemic, we compare the usage of distinctive AAPI context words in the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. This analysis provides insights into how the narrative surrounding AAPI issues may have evolved during a critical period in recent history. In conclusion, our research methodology combines the power of NLP techniques, such as LDA, tidytext, and nltk, to dissect unstructured text data from liberal and conservative news outlets. Through this process, we aim to uncover and compare distinctive patterns in language use and sentiment regarding AAPI, shedding light on the potential influence of partisanship on news portrayal. Additionally, by examining changes before and after the pandemic, we intend to reveal shifts in the narrative, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of media portrayal of AAPI issues.\n\n\n\nPopulation framing and Sample Selection\nTo test our hypotheses, we collected a corpus of 381 articles about AAPIs from two major U.S. newspapers, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and New York Times (NYT) published in 2019 and in 2021 using the ProQuest and LexisNexis Academic databases. Both are globally influential major newspapers of record with massive readership and long-established reputations for excellence in reporting and first-hand coverage. Thus, we would expect less divergence in portrayals of AAPI in these sources than we would in a comparison of more extreme and opinionated sources or in a comparison of very different types of outlets. Initially, articles were converted into plain text format for ease of processing. Given the focus on AAPI-related content, we identified a specific set of keywords and phrases related to AAPI, such as ‘Asian American,’ ‘Pacific Islander,’ and ‘AAPI.’ This word set was instrumental in filtering the outlet-specific population of articles and selecting the sample.\n\n\nWord Ratio Tables\nThis method involves comparing the frequency of specific words in articles from the New York Times (NYT) and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two outlets with differing editorial leanings. By calculating word ratios, this analysis aims to uncover potential biases and thematic differences in how these outlets portrayed AAPI communities, particularly across two key periods, 2019 and 2021. The core of this analysis lies in the calculation of word ratios. This involved comparing the frequency of each word in AAPI-related sentences across the two news outlets. The ratio was calculated as follows: for a given word, its frequency in the NYT articles was divided by its frequency in the WSJ articles (and vice versa), adjusted by adding 1 to the denominator to avoid division by zero. This method was applied separately for each outlet and each time period (2019 and 2021), enabling a comparative analysis across both dimensions.\n \n\nInterpretation\nWord ratio analysis determines the relative prevalence of certain words in NYT articles vs WSJ articles in a specific year relative to the percentage of AAPI-subject sentences to non-subject sentences. This descriptive analysis lends support to our first hypothesis regarding differences between conservative and liberal national news outlets. For example, in Table 3 below, the word “women,” has a ratio of 8.5, suggesting that it is 8.5 times more prevalent in NYT AAPI-subject sentences compared to those in WSJ. This shows that NYT covers more gender-centric issues related to AAPI in its news coverage than WSJ. Secondly, NYT also appears to have more references to specific geographic references (“South”, “Hawaii”, “Pacific”). Lastly, NYT has more mentions of political terms like “president,” “Congress,” and “political.”, as well as references to specific candidates (“Yang”) in the pre-pandemic period. Conversely, words like “Hawaii,” and “Chinese” are more evenly distributed between NYT and WSJ.\nWhen it comes to the ratio of words shared between WSJ and NYT in the pre-pandemic period in in 2019, words like “Education,” “College,” “University”, “Company”, “networks”, “organization”, “school”, “diversity” are significantly more prevalent in WSJ compared to NYT, based on the given ratios in Table 2 above. This supports the perception that the Wall Street Journal ties AAPI subject matter and context to academic success. Thus, the model minority myth could be at play here. More rigorous techniques are required to make further definitive statements.\n \n\n\nInterpretation\nIn post-pandemic 2021, COVID-specific terms like “percent,” “reported,” “February”, “2021” highlight the relevance of the context to the ongoing pandemic in NYT coverage of AAPIs (Table 3 above). Further, among the top words with very high ratios were words like “Identity”, “politics”, “Kamala”, “Harris”, “voters”, “immigrants”, suggesting a distinctive emphasis in NYT coverage, indicating a bigger focus on politics compared to WSJ. Immigration-related terms like “immigrants” and “voters” suggest a connection between AAPI subjects and discussion of immigration policies. The presence of terms like “incidents,” “activists,” and “attacked” suggests a focus on rising incidents or attacks against the AAPI community in the wake of Covid and activism in support of the AAPI community. It should be noted that some of the results contain database template words which clouded the results. Unfortunately, time did not permit us to rectify this in our scripts.\nNext, when it comes to the ratio of words shared between WSJ and NYT in the post-pandemic period in 2021 (Table 4 above), words like “Street,” “Business,” “Executive,” “Minority,” “court,” “order,” “judge,” and “Legal” are among the top words with very high ratios, suggesting a distinctive emphasis in WSJ’s coverage of AAPI. These words suggest a strong business and legal focus in WSJ’s coverage of AAPI subjects. Further, terms like “Race,” “Racial”,“African-American,” and “Hispanic” perhaps indicate a comparative focus on the racial and social aspect in the WSJ coverage of AAPI in relation to other racial groups in the US, such as African-Americans and Hispanic. In addition, higher word ratios of words like “Education,” “People,” “students,” and “elite” suggest a focus on educational and cultural attributes of AAPI in WSJ, which provides more support for our third hypothesis regarding the perpetuation of ‘model minority’ stereotype about AAPI in conservative outlets. Lastly, terms like “Shootings,” “murder”, “Violence,” “Crimes,” and “Spa” suggest a focus on crime and violence against AAPI in the post-pandemic period in WSJ coverage which was also seen in NYT coverage in 2021.\n\n\n\nTopic Modeling\nTopic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique for finding and tracing clusters of words (called “topics” in shorthand) in large bodies of texts. There are several models that can be plugged into the topic modeling process. I chose Latent Dirichlet Allocation for its ability to better generalize and its popularity in the humanities fields than LSA or pLSA. Like other clustering techniques, it is up the scientist to determine the parameters and number of topics which can change the final results. I used elbow plots that mapped the coherence (AKA the perplexity) against the number of topics. I applied this method iteratively between the partisan outlets and their pre and post COVID years.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: 4 Topics in 2019 NYT\n\n\nHere, we see the results for the NYT 2019 set of articles making mention of AAPI. Not all of the topics are very specific, or clear. The Presidential Campaign of Andrew Yang clearly led much of the discussion surrounding AAPI 2019. This could suggest some version of identity politics. A closer look at the sample or sampling years prior would be necessary to confirm this as a more consistent theme.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Topics in 2019 WSJ\n\n\nI thought the results for 2019 WSJ sample was the most illuminating. Nearly all the topics relate to academic achievement and admissions, except one which captured ProQuest template data. This is especially of interest in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down college diversity and inclusion policies in a case brought before them by AAPI. This appears to superficially support our hypothesis that there is a difference in coverage based on partisanship/ideology, at least pre-covid. It also seems to support superficially that stereotypes could be at play. A more nuanced and technically rigorous look at the data is necessary to conclude this. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Topics in 2021 NYT\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Topics in 2021 WSJ\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nTopic Modeling analysis provides additional support for our first hypothesis on the differences between liberal and conservative outlets, though the differences are once again more pronounced pre-pandemic. Again, in 2019 education-related words (“students”, “admissions”, “college”, etc.) dominated two of the four WSJ topics and zero of the four NYT topics. That year, only one of the four WSJ topics was dominated by politics-related words (“democratic”, “political”, “candidates”, etc.), while three of the four NYT articles were. This difference persisted in 2021, when one of the five WSJ topics was dominated by education-related words and none of the NYT were. Yet differences in 2021 were again less stark, as both outlets shifted some focus to attacks on AAPI and both had some focus on political issues and figures. Both outlets began covering AAPI related hate crimes and violence which superseded their previous coverage of identity politics and college admissions, respectively. Both outlets seem to maintain some level of pre-covid topics, albeit at a lower frequency. Thus, we cannot say the convergence is support for the null hypothesis. It should be noted that had we chosen outlets considered to be more ideologically polarized, we likely would see larger partisan differences bear out both in the pre and post covid years. This evidence supports our hypothesis that covid changed the nature of news coverage in relation to AAPI. However, since topic modeling removes much of the nuance and context, further analysis is necessary to determine if a significant partisan difference is detectable. \n\n\n\n\nTHE END"

    "text": "Co-Authors: Haley Puddy and Hoda Eslafadi\n\n\nOur analysis plan includes using secondary data collected from the largest known dataset on the health of college students called The American Health College Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA III). It is a nationally recognized research survey consisting of 52 items on college student’s health habits, behaviors, and perceptions. The data used for this project will be from the Spring of 2022, where 69,131 U.S. college students from across the country participated and completed the survey. Descriptive statistics using t-tests and chi-squares will be used as well as logistic regression models to measure what risk and protective factors have a positive or negative effect on victimization. Additionally, interaction and moderation effects will be used to determine if any combination of risk or protective factors exacerbate the effects on victimization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDV: Victimization (violent, sexual, IPV) IV(s): Risk & Protective factors for victimization\nRisk factors: Engagement in risky behaviors (sex, alcohol usage, partying, fighting, and drug usage) Mental health problems\nProtective factors: Overall health Healthy decision making Social connectedness Sleep health Safe driving\nControls: race/ethnicity, relationship status, gender\nThe purpose of this study is to reaffirm and discover what risk and protective factors increase or decrease the likelihood of victimization among a large sample of college students. There is a wealth of knowledge in this area showing that mental health problems and engagement in risky behaviors, like partying, sex, alcohol usage, and drug usage, significantly increase one’s likelihood of being victimized (Azimi & Daigle, 2021; Turanovic et al., 2018). Additionally, previous research has found social connectedness to be one of the strongest protective factors against victimization (McLoughlin et al., 2019; Kast et al., 2016). This research goes in line with social control and bond theories that argue that individuals are prevented from engaging in delinquency, and thus victimization, by having strong bonds to society, family, friends, and conventional activities (Hirschi, 1969). Literature is lacking, however, on protective factors related to overall health and propensity to make safer decisions. This study aims to contribute to the literature by reaffirming what is already clear about the risk and protective factors of victimization, as well as adding to the literature about additional protective factors that may be negatively associated with victimization. The results of this study have potential to build upon the well-researched base on victimization and suggest new protective factors for other researchers to take a closer look at.\n\n\n\nUnsupervised learning methods such as hierarchical clustering is typically not done with labeled or structured data. Although this Stata file is very well structured, we trust the process will vet our regression findings and illuminate new research areas to explore. The nature of Gowers allows for different data types by scaling the similarity or dissimilarity between variables on a 0 to 1 binary value. We chose the computational method of Gowers matrix rather than similarity because a majority of inputs are ordinal categorical data types, with some nominal and discrete integer responses. A majority of the categorical inputs are binary. This allows for a more intuitive interpretation of the resulting clusters. For linkage computation, we chose complete linkage for a more balanced dendrogram.\nI chose agglomerative clustering over divisive clustering because I am interested in a larger number of smaller clusters as opposed to the reverse of fewer and larger clusters. In real business or research scenarios, data analysts often compare the results of both methods before moving on to the next stage of the modeling/discovery phase.\n\n\n\nDue to the nature of survey data and the high proportion of missing answers, missingness must be meaningfully dealt with despite the ability of Gowers to deal with missingness. A high proportion of missingness will cause the clustering to find unreliable dissimilarities. Additionally, the common methods of list-wise deletion and mean/median imputation were eliminated as decent methods for the purposes of clustering. This is due to the non-random variation that often characterizes missingness in survey data. To preserve the variance, Multiple Imputation by Chain Equations (MICE) was utilized. We chose the random forest MICE method for its ability to preserve the distribution, variance, accuracy, and uncertainty in data with a high proportion of missingness. We rely on a large number of cases (over 3000 rows) to offset the probability that bias was introduced as a function of the amount of missingness and imputation. In real business and research scenarios, care should be taken to evaluate the sensitivity and quality of the imputation method by testing and comparing against other methods.\n\n\n\nDetermining the optimum number of K clusters is important to the aims of the research and should serve the internal and external validity of the project. The method of choosing K and how to assess the chosen method’s performance are important aspects to projects in professional and research settings. We used many methods including visually inspecting the dendrogram, silhouette plots, and an elbow plot to determine the optimal number of K clusters.\n Lastly, our decision to rely on 8 clusters is supported by our visual analysis of the plain dendrogram (Figure 1). This dendrogram is noticeably convoluted and complex because of the sheer number of rows included. In any case, we believe it is necessary to sacrifice simplicity and interpretability in order to combat overfitting that is introduced via the inclusion of all 36 variables. Immediately it is clear some outliers are causing very small clusters to form that likely offers very little insight to our research. Three clades, both on the far left and far right side of the dendrogram, have the smallest number of leaves and are the top two highest heights of all the clades. We rely on 8 because both the Y-axis at height five emerge 8 distinct groups in the dendrogram (including the outliers). It should be noted that K = 8 should merely be a starting point.\n\n\n\nThe analysis revealed disproportionate memberships across eight clusters, with large variances in case numbers, suggesting biases and challenges in creating distinct clusters. The eighth cluster was deemed unusable due to having only one case. The data allowed for easier comparison of cluster means, particularly in victimization metrics. Cluster one, with the lowest victimization metrics, and cluster five showed high levels of well-restedness, aligning with a positive correlation between sleep and decreased victimization odds. However, cluster seven contradicted this trend, showing high sleep and victimization levels.\nThe analysis found no strong positive correlation between the number of sexual partners and victimization, with clusters showing varied victimization rates regardless of their sexual partner means.\nVolunteering was identified as a risk factor in the regression models. Clusters with low victimization rates generally had low volunteering means, except for cluster six, which was an anomaly.\nThe analysis suggested that questioning sexuality might be a risk factor for victimization. Clusters showed varying correlations with sexual orientation and victimization rates. The study’s decision to limit the analysis to eight clusters may have restricted insights, especially considering that the survey response for sexual orientation was a nine-level factor variable. The large size of some clusters likely diluted and spread key factors across groups, obscuring potential insights.\nBeing single was found to be a risk factor for victimization, with clusters having higher victimization rates more likely to have medians indicating single status. However, some anomalies were noted.\nThere was no clear correlation between time spent playing sports and victimization rates across clusters.\nThe analysis, while highlighting some correlations, also underscores the complexity and variability of the relationship between sexual orientation and victimization. The discrepancies between the regression findings and the cluster analysis suggest a need for further, more granular investigation, possibly with a larger number of clusters or different analytical approaches.\n\n\n\nWhile normally the a priori needs of interpretable or predictive modeling crucially require testing and review of collinearity and correlation among variables, this was not included in the hierarchical clustering process. To conserve time and effort, we focused on methods learned in class that we do not have established knowledge on. In a real life scenario, we would use methods to test collinearity either with Principle Component Analysis or a simple correlation matrix. Additionally, more care would be taken to meaningfully analyze and strategize outliers and skewness. For example, the linkage method chosen here was complete linkage. In hindsight, Ward’s method seems to be a better choice as it is more suited to outliers and is less sensitive to noise. Additionally, scaling/normalizing the data was skipped in the interest of time. In hindsight, this step is very crucial because some inputs in the cluster statistics show large differences between the median and mean. Skewness was not adequately addressed. This is certain to have impacted the amount of reliable knowledge from the analysis."
